      <p>
        <strong>Custom Sounds. Minted Memories.</strong><br><br>
        Founded in 2025 at the dawn of the AI renaissance, <strong>Sound Mint</strong> was born from a simple yet powerful idea: every moment in life deserves its own soundtrack.
        <br><br>
        From your first wedding dance to a gender reveal, birthday bash, or brand launch, we create <strong>custom songs tailored to your exact vision</strong> — blending emotion, artistry, and precision. But our reach goes far beyond personal celebrations. We craft original compositions for <strong>podcasts, businesses, influencer campaigns, movie trailers, video games</strong>, and more, each one tuned to match your story, your brand, and your energy.
        <br><br>
        Every Sound Mint project begins with a <strong>“song title” design philosophy</strong> — your song isn’t just a track, it’s a story. To bring that story to life, we guide each customer through a <strong>detailed intake application</strong>. This form helps us understand your event, your style, and your preferences — from genre and mood to lyrics and instrumentation. You can submit your own lyrics or let us craft them for you using our <strong>expert-level AI prompting techniques</strong> and top-tier music generation software.
        <br><br>
        We offer a <strong>full genre library</strong> where you can mix and match styles to create your own unique sound — from cinematic ballads to EDM drops, country twang to lo-fi chill. You’ll also find a curated list of <strong>instrumentals and mood types</strong>, complete with song ideas and inspiration to help shape your vision.
        <br><br>
